# Data_Visualization_Challenge
In this repository you'll find all of the files related to the Challenge No.5: Data visualization.
As a starting point I used the pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb provided on the files for this challenge. 
You'll see  that I used the Mouse ID "l509" to make the line plot, this was the ID used on the starting code as well. I selected the same Mouse ID for comparisson reasons only, but you can see that my plot has grids, to differenciate it from the starting code.
